# A very simple node application using redis to store the visit counter

# This app is created to test the docker commands

# Here we have a end point written in Node and will have a redis client. 

# Demo for docker-compose with restart policies

# There are 4 restart policies 

# 1. No - this is default
# 2. Always - restart the docker container once it is stopped by any reason
# 3. On-failure - Only restart if the container stopped with an error code
# 4. Unless-stopped - Only restart if the container is stopped forcefully
